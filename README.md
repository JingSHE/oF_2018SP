When you are pushing your work, do it in the correct project/name directory.  Don't add/delete others work.  All github activity will be timestamped with your name.

For every project commit at least:

  * One or more screenshots of the program showing required features
  * A text file which lists the requirements a description of your solution and where (line number) in the code this was done
  
You may optionally include a data directory if needed.  Be careful with sizes here as everyone will have to download your assets!
